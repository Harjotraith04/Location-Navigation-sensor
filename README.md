This noteboook has worked with the variation of different sensors that are compatible with Arduino/Rasberry pi that are :
1)accelerometer
2)magnetic field
3)gyroscope
4)rotation vector
5)WiFi
6)Bluetooth iBeacon
7)ground truths (waypoint locations)

This study of various sensors is essential for building the actuators and IOT component of a project that is very crucial for building a resposive model .
